and building meaningful applications. My journey in tech has been driven by
curiosity and a desire to make a positive impact through code.
"""
```

#### Skills & Technologies

Update the skills lists to match your expertise:

```python
"skills": {
    "languages": ["Python", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Java"],
    "frameworks": ["React", "Node.js", "Django", "Flask", "Streamlit"],
    "cloud": ["AWS", "Azure", "Google Cloud"],
    "ai_ml": ["TensorFlow", "PyTorch", "LangChain", "OpenAI"],
    "databases": ["PostgreSQL", "MongoDB", "Redis"],
    "tools": ["Git", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "CI/CD"]
}
```

#### Social Media Links

Replace the placeholder URLs with your actual profiles:

```python
"social_media": {
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/your-actual-profile",
    "github": "https://github.com/your-actual-username",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/your-actual-handle",

    "üìö Always learning something new",

    "emoji": "üë®‚Äçüíª",  # Change to your preferred emoji
    "image_url": None  # Add your image URL here if you have one
}
```

    "use_emoji": False,
    "emoji": "üë®‚Äçüíª",
    "image_url": "https://your-image-url.com/profile.jpg"
}
```

### üé® Customization Tips

1. **Keep it concise:** The sidebar has limited space, so keep descriptions brief and impactful.

2. **Use emojis strategically:** Emojis add personality but don't overuse them.

3. **Update regularly:** Keep your information current, especially your current focus and projects.

4. **Be authentic:** Share genuine interests and fun facts that reflect your personality.

5. **Professional tone:** While being personal, maintain a professional appearance.

### üöÄ Advanced Customization

#### Adding New Sections

To add new sections to your profile, edit `services/sidebar.py` and add new markdown sections.

#### Custom Styling

You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS in the sidebar component.

#### Dynamic Content

Consider adding dynamic content like:

- Current time/date
- Latest blog posts
- Recent GitHub activity
- Current project status

### üì± Social Media Integration

The sidebar includes buttons for your social media profiles. When users click these buttons, they'll see links to your actual profiles. Make sure all URLs are correct and accessible.

### üîÑ Updating Your Profile

1. Edit `services/profile_config.py`
2. Save the file
3. Restart your Streamlit application
4. The changes will appear in the sidebar immediately
