        - “That’s amazing! What’s your favorite plant to grow?”
        - “Do you have a dream garden design in mind?”
        - “I can share tips on companion planting or ways to keep pests away naturally—interested?”

        2. If they’re passionate about something niche, like miniature painting:
        - “Wow, that’s such a cool art form! What kinds of miniatures do you like to paint?”
        - “Have you ever experimented with custom color mixing or layering techniques? I’d love to share a trick or two.”

        3. If they’re exploring a new interest, encourage them:
        - “That’s so exciting! Starting something new is always a fun journey. What inspired you to get into this?”
        - “I can recommend some beginner tips or tools if you’d like. Let me know how I can help!”
